                                             Hi, my name is XhinSade Riri and I am a 2nd Year level of Information Technology Student. 
                                             It was'nt part of the plan to take Information Technology at the first place.
                                             After months of studying, I've been interested learning and exploring the Information Technology. 
                     

                                             In my personal life, I enjoy watching movie, photography, and exploring the vibrant arts scene, 
                                             listening to music, exploring new things and ways, nature viewing and enjoying the life.
                                             Throughout my journey, I have faced numerous challenges, from navigating the uncertainties of a 
                                             creative career to dealing with personal losses. Each obstacle has taught me resilience and the 
                                                                           importance of perseverance.
                       
                                             Thank you for joining me on this journey through my life. 
                                             I hope my experiences resonate with you and inspire you to embrace your own story.
